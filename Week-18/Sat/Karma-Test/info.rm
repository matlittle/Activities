Instructions

Using your Karma setup, write tests for the multiply function we met in our last class. Make sure to test that it handles errors properly.

After you've written tests describing the behavior of multiply, open a terminal and start Karma.

In another terminal, write your implementation for multiply. Notice that Karma executes your tests every time you change your implementation.
